<p>Purcellville, VA — A lot can change in ten years. Nobody knows that better than the artists and planning committee members of the Western Loudoun Artists Studio Tour, which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year. Started in 2006 as a coalition project uniting individual artists and arts organizations in Western Loudoun County, the first tour had 25 member artists. This year’s tour will be held on June 20 and 21, and will feature 63 artists. Organizers anticipate upwards of 2000 visitors to 36 sites in Western Loudoun County. Over the ten years, 148 different artists have participated on the tour, and they have been visited by patrons from over 72 towns in 11 different states.</p>

<p>In honor of WLAST’s tenth anniversary, several special events have been planned for this year’s tour. Artists and local businesses are teaming up in a “guerrilla art” project based on the tour’s now iconic hand. The larger-than-life hands, decorated by tour artists, will be on display in various locations throughout Loudoun County, beginning with the Leesburg Flower and Garden Festival, followed by a “Show of Hands” display at the opening of the downtown Leesburg Mervin Jackson Park on May 1 during the Town of Leesburg’s First Friday event.</p>

<p>In many cases, WLAST is the only place where the public can see local artists where they work, experience personal interaction, and view live art demonstrations with professional and emerging artists. The mission of the tour is to help promote Loudoun County as a scenic and cultural destination by producing a tour of our county’s visual artists, to celebrate their work and to provide an educational experience for the public.
As the tour celebrates its tenth anniversary it prides itself on introducing visitors to the amazing wealth of artistic talent located right here in Loudoun County. Its goal is to introduce local and regional patrons to a weekend of education, inspiration, and one-on-one interaction with the arts. The Studio Tour continues to be recognized as a significant event in helping to brand Western Loudoun County as a premier arts destination.
The Western Loudoun Studio Tour is a free event open to the public. For more information, visit www.wlast.org.</p>
