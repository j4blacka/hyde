I am a multi-media freelance artist, production designer, photographer & color consultant, mostly known for my murals & selfie wings around Loudoun County’s streets & businesses.

After dressing store windows, dyeing costumes, painting props & 50’s scenery for film, opera, Broadway, Disney & Jim Henson Prods in NYC, I prefer to work in large format.

I paint people, animals, abstracts, surreal landscapes for gallery exhibitions & private commissions out of my studio in Purcellville. I also freelance painting murals & faux finishes. I love texture, so I expose woodgrain, gild & oxidize metals on my paintings, to draw the viewer in to touch the surface.

I am working on a foxhunting painting series to be displayed at Middleburg Common Grounds in September & at Long Branch Farm Historic Mansion in November. I have been featured on articles in the Loudoun Now Newspaper, Get Out Loudoun, Leesburg Lifestyle & Middleburg Life magazines. Come take pics with my wings, be part of my art & tag me!
