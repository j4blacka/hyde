My fascination in weaving began when I was about 9 years old and saw someone weaving in Williamsburg.  I knew that someday I would learn to weave, I just didnâ€™t know it would have to wait until I retired.  I love to weave household items that will be used, scarves, towels, rugs, even shoelaces and key rings.  And as much as I love to weave them, I love to demonstrate weaving, to share the joy of creation, and to show that this is not a forgotten art. I weave primarily in cotton yarn or recycled materials.  What could be better than turning old blue jeans into rugs and old towels into bathmats!
