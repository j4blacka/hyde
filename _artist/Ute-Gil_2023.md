My goal is to create paintings that show my love of nature and animals and at the same time express the essence and emotions of my subjects. I consciously reduce details, keeping my brushstrokes loose and impressionistic, and therefore allow the viewer a more personal interpretation of the image. It is more important to me that a painting is beautiful and compelling than true to reality. I find many of my inspirations from the rural areas and farms that I visit in Western Loudoun County and from my travels to other countries. The paintings are created plein air, as well as in my studio. Oil is my preferred medium because of its textural qualities.
