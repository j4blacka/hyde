Originally from Michigan, Bethany Widom grew up around industrious people. Learning to bake and sew at a young age, sparked her creative side. She used frosting to paint, sculpt, and decorate cakes. By age sixteen, she was rearranging patterns and manipulating fabric to come up with her own fashion creations.

A resident of Leesburg, she attended classes at Loudoun Academy of Art. She studied under Michael Davis for several years, learning techniques used by Rembrandt, Jean Baptiste Chardin, and Pieter Claesz.

She is intrigued by the glimpse into someone's everyday life illustrated by Old World paintings, and the subject matter of her own still life paintings reflect that intrigue. However, unlike many artist who seek to emulate the old masters, Bethany turns to a more recent past for her subject matter: objects that were a part of her own life and that of her family, things well-used and well-loved. Reminisce as you view nostalgic Life, Still Life, and Landscape oil paintings.
