I work with functional forms, primarily starting on the wheel.

I like to alter some of the forms by pushing, pressing, and cutting. A simple manipulation can transform surface and shape. My intent is to have interactions with my work that are visual, physical, and functional.  My work tends to have components that have contrasting characteristics. When looking at my teapots, the bodies are thrown with clean lines, focusing on symmetrical form. Once I cut into them, the form changes to something that has movement and flow.  The handles change in size, shape and direction. Spouts narrow and widen. The knobs are small sculptures, organic and individual.  As I step back and look at my work, I see different combinations.  Rigid – Organic Organic – Texture Ergonomic – Balance Form – Function Visual – Physical  There are always variations. Which in turn, keeps me looking and wanting to create more.
