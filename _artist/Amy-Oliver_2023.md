Amy Oliver began her clay journey approximately 29 years ago, she studied ceramics at James Madison University, then apprenticed at Hawksbill Pottery. Amy moved to Loudoun county in 2001 and officially opened Monkeytown Pottery in 2005. She has continually worked to improve her craftsmanship, her emphasis is on form function and surface design. Having a background in drawing and art history as well, she often adds illustrations and her own version of mythology to her pots. She likes her pots to tell a story.  She uses stoneware clay, slip and glaze to accomplish this while keeping the pots food safe and functional. She hopes that they are a part of everyday life and are truly used regularly, everything therefore, is dishwasher, microwave and oven safe.
