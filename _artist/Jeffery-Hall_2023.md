In my exploration of the figure I am really composing a reflection of the great beauty and the majesty of creation itself and as such, it’s only natural that the honing of my craft is something that I do for the purpose of trying to be as faithful to that reflection and as honest in my response as I am humanly capable.

I focus on monumental and heroic poses that exaggerate the figure. This gives me more latitude for a strong pose, and that is where I find the beauty. The figure is more than just a body in motion -- it is also a mind at work. While the human body itself is beautiful, the mind affects body language, and the inner emotions can be realized with a gesture. I generally don’t concern myself with scale relationships within a sculptural piece in order to push the narrative, in that respect the image becomes a little surreal.

I have received numerous museum sculpture awards. My hundreds of architectural sculptures adorn government buildings, and many other public spaces.
