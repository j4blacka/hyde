My process of creating art in the studio is experimental and varied. I also work en plein air whenever I have the chance, as I find direct observation of light and the landscape to be the best teacher. Travel helps my process by providing the magic of that first impression in a new place as well as the brief moments of the journey that can easily be overlooked. The artwork is a record of my experiences, the footprints left behind after the dance is over. It takes time for ideas to develop before I am ready to commit them to paper. Pastels offer immediacy and a directness which are an important foil to that “fermentation” period because they allow me to work quickly as my ideas evolve.
