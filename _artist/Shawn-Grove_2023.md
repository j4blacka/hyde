The perception of beauty can be found in nature with its predictable, yet still unpredictable patterns. The beauty of the wood fired process is the creation of one of a kind pieces of work that can never be replicated in their entirety due to the chaotic flux of the fire. Chaos is order disguised within disorder and such is the wood fired process. Utilizing elements of nature including raw earthen clay, ash glaze, wood, and fire the production of an organically based art form is achievable. I believe strongly in the interaction and experience of humans with art forms, as art in its earliest creations was interwoven with daily life. Wood Fired Pottery achieves these ideals through functional wares and sculptural innovations.
