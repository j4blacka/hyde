<blockquote>
“I enjoy making pots that people use to enrich their daily lives. When making my pottery becomes like breathing, the rhythm and harmony that I seek in my life is reflected in the objects that I make. Often given as gifts to family and friends, they are symbols of the “humanness” we still share with each other.”
</blockquote>

Today, Norton Pottery is enjoyed in homes in over 85 countries on all seven continents. His work has twice received acclaim in the New York Times as well as being voted best local artist by readers of the Loudoun Times Mirror.
