Lori DeMark is a Purcellville-based jewelry artist and owner of DeMarkwear Jewelry.

Her work is inspired by designs found in nature and textures that are part of our everyday life. She creates jewelry using sterling silver, brass, stoneware or porcelain clay. The majority of her designs include earrings, necklaces, and pendants. Metal jewelry: Sterling silver, copper,  brass metals are forged using a cold hammering techniques or embossed using a printing press to create designs into material. Metal is then bent or formed into one-of-a-kind unique designs. Some pieces are soldered while others are embellished with glass or stone beads that are hand-selected for each design. Ceramic designs: Clay pendants and earrings are created using traditional stoneware or porcelain clay, which is fired to cone 5 or 6. Clay is stamp-pressed using the artistâ€™s designs and objects found in nature. Lori has a studio background in printmaking and ceramics which has influenced her jewelry designs.
