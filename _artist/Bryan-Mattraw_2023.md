I planned to become a painter as well as an art teacher but a course in pottery changed all that. I was immediately hooked on ceramics and began making pots while I pursued my degree. Pottery combines the abstraction of form, with the purity of purpose and a connection to science. I have been engaged in teaching and pot-making ever since. I make pots that are intended for the hand and home, which I hope will be beautiful to the eye and the soul of the be-holder.
