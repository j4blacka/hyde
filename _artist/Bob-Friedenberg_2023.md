I started drawing in college while pursuing my doctorate in theoretical nuclear physics. It’s been a lifelong hobby and now a concentrated passion to record and manipulate my mind’s wanderings.

My work is a collection of very detailed black & white pen & ink drawings all made using a .25mm Rapidograph.

Everything I do is inked entirely by hand, utilizing a wide variety of themes ranging from naturalistic scenery to devices and mechanical objects to science fiction and fantasy. Often, I incorporate pictures, words, symbols, equations, and anything else I can think of into my drawings to add depth, and texture, and to engage the viewer on a long term basis.  In fact, recently I’ve started replicating the equations from my PhD dissertation as graphics.  The idea is to keep you looking and always finding something new.
