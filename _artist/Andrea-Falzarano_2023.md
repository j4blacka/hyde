I am inspired by manipulating glass producing different textures, color, transparencies, depth and flow.

Since starting my journey as a glass artist, I continually am amazed at how glass transforms and dances as it becomes part of a stained-glass art panel or when it is fused under high heat in a kiln. I enjoy working with several types of glass including sheet glass, frit (glass chips), stringers (glass strips), and painting with glass powders.

I make both stained glass and fused glass art. In stained glass, I often embed gemstones or other items into a piece to create what I call a “window to the soul”. I am passionate about fused glass as well, and fire it at different temperatures in the kiln to create different effects. My hope is that my art showcases glass as an art medium for all to love as much as I do.
