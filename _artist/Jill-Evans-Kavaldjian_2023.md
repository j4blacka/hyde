I majored in Painting & Printmaking in college, and I continue to pursue both media to this day.

My relief prints are bold and playful.

My painting has evolved over the years, and now is a hybrid method of underpainting and then layering with blended color pencil. The mood is generally quiet and more contemplative.

I turn to printmaking to express my humor, and to paining to express my wonder at the everyday beauty around me.
