I like to find and capture scenes which evoke a mood or a strong sense of place or of time. I try to include evidence of different human experiences, feelings and values.

My intaglio etchings, relief prints and digital prints begin as drawings or photomontages that I combine,  manipulate, and abstract so that they become less specific and bit more symbolic.
