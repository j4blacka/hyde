My work is an expression of the joy that comes from doing what I love. I begin my paintings with a very dark and often black background. I then layer the painting with color and texture as I play with the overall composition on the canvas. I favor bright colors and organic shapes in my paintings. Each piece is painted with great care to bring you a vivid piece of my imagination.
