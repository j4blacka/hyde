My Passion is working with clay - a soft malleable substance- throwing, forming, urging it into an object of both beauty and function. An object which can be admired, touched, held, and used in daily life.  This process and transformation of the soft clay into a hard and beautiful object meant to be seen, used, passed along, maybe even eventually broken and given back to the earth seems to mirror personal growth and transformation.

I use mid range clay and glazes in my work and enjoy glaze colors and themes which can be found in nature. I try to incorporate a combination of family, prayer, meditation , nature and the creation of pottery into every single day of my life as part of my own personal growth and transformation. It gives me great insight and joy to create a one of a kind piece of pottery artwork. I hope others enjoy viewing and utilizing my pots as much as I enjoy making them. 20 years as a potter, and 12 years in Loudoun, I am thankful everyday that I can create!
