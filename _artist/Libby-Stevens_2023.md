I am an artist inspired by the natural world around me here in Loudoun county. I enjoy traveling the back country roads to find rustic barns, overgrown fields and rural farms. I grew up surrounded by artists: my mother and her interior design skills and watercolors, and my grandmother’s Texas oil paintings.

I work from life, outdoors “en plein air”, and from my own photographs. I enjoy many art mediums: oil, pastel, watercolor, and bead jewelry. I participate in solo shows, regional juried exhibits and have received many awards for my art. I am a longtime member of the Loudoun Sketch Club and a signature member of The Maryland Pastel Society.
