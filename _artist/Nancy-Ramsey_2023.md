Art, to me, is primarily about the process.  It’s my reaction both to the world and to the marks I am making on the canvas.  The finished product becomes a record of my process.

I may find inspiration in a figure, a landscape, music, or the bits of images and thought that swirl in my head.  Regardless of how I begin, the work evolves beyond my initial plan.  The act of painting is improvisational.  As I work, each new move comes as a reaction to the one before.  I can’t tell you exactly what I’ll do next until I’ve finished the current stroke.  Although I consider these elements as I work, the act of painting is often spontaneous and unstructured.   It’s a conversation, where I enjoy the twists and turns of the interaction rather than worrying about where I’ll end.  What is left, the final painting, is a chronicle of my process, of that conversation between my intuition and the materials.
