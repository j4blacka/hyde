Art has been important to me in my whole life. I feel very fortunate to live in Loudoun County, where thereâ€™s beautiful scenery everywhere to enjoy painting. I use oils, pastels, and watercolors to illustrate what I see. I have also been teaching for more than 30 years to every age group. I enjoy both teaching and painting.
