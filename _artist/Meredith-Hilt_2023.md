Meredith Hilt is a metalsmith and jewelry artist.  Her items are unique, and handmade using silver or copper sheet metal/wire, stone and sometimes polymer clay.

Meredithâ€™s love of animals and nature are often the inspiration of her work.  Using age-old techniques with saw, hammer, torch, and hand files, the resulting pieces become wearable pieces of artwork.
