A Large Format (8X10 inch negatives) Analog Photographer for over 40 years, my most recent work has evolved into the classic and most beautiful form of photography with “Platinum/Palladium” printing methods.  This 150 year old hand coating process of the paper is for producing contact prints only. Its extreme delicate and beautiful qualities yield unique and individual results to each image that may only be obtained in this procedure.  These platinum images will be displayed along with my traditionally enlarged prints, all from 8X10 negatives.  Gallery and full access to my Darkroom will be made available.  All prints are signed and numbered and available for purchase.
