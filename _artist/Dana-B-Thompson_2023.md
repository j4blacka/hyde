I respond to loose representations of organic and inorganic every-day objects next to one another in dramatic compositions. Vintage next to vegetation. Things that have relationships, maybe in ways most donâ€™t think of, maybe with a little twist. I shoot for compositions that are larger than life, tightly cropped or taken to the edge, almost to the point of tension.

I clearly enjoy painting shiny things...reflective, transparent and translucent and how they respond to light. I strive to incorporate loose with refined brushstrokes, soft and hard edges, complementary colors in juxtaposition and true observation with exaggeration.

My most earnest goal in many of my paintings (and life) is to make you smile.
