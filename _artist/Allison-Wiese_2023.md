Growing up in a small lake town in Michigan heavily influences my artwork. Beaches, lakes, and sunsets make their way into many pieces. Over the past two decades I have painted while also practicing as clinical therapist specializing in adolescent depression and anxiety. Most recently my husband and two young daughters have gained footing in Leesburg, Virginia, and I have devoted myself to art full-time. My background as a therapist very much informs my creative process, and ultimately I try to cultivate a sense of joy with every piece.

Portraying water-based subjects while playing with colors, movements, and patterns in big ocean waves is what I am drawn to most. My art is a love letter to and a meditation on everything in and around our vital oceans. However, the cows in Virginia are rubbing off on me, and much of my work now falls into the category of "Surf & Turf."  Once I started to put cows on surf boards (initially as a humorous suggestion from my husband) I just couldn't stop. I hope to elicit a smile or even a chuckle as I continue to experiment with putting dogs and other farm animals on my giant breaking waves.
