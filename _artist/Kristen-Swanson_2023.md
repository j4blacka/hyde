I work with a mid-range English Grolleg porcelain clay body and fire to cone 7 in oxidation in an electric kiln.

My original designs are hand painted and carved using a technique called sgraffito. I use a variety of brushes, blades, and slip trail bottles to apply pigmented clay slip, or underglaze, to the unfired clay body. Once surface work is complete, pieces are bisque fired, clear glazed, and fired a second time to vitrification.

Asian art has long been an influence in my work — my childhood home was filled with Asian furniture, tapestries, scroll paintings, and sculpture. I am further influenced by both traditional and contemporary textile patterns as well as traditional botanical motifs.

I am committed to functional ceramic art and want my pieces to be used in the everyday domestic landscape of people’s lives. I believe that intimate contact with objects that are handmade, intentionally crafted, and beautiful can transform common experiences into meaningful experiences.
