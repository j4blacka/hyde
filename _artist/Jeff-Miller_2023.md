My camera is a time machine.  But my time machine captures more than just time.  It captures people, places, and things.  It captures emotions, memories, and dreams.  It captures stories.

A photographer is like a painter, but my canvass is in my head and the image in my imagination.  My brushes and palette are the box and lens used to capture light.  I just need to be in the right place, at the right time, and use the camera to record the scene in front of me as I envisioned it in my imagination.  I enjoy trying to record these moments that will never occur again. If I can anticipate these moments and capture them with my camera, then I can preserve them for everyone. In a certain way I have captured time in a box and printed that moment on paper.
