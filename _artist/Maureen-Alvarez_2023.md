I am a Loudoun County potter doing what I love -creating functional and decorative work from my home studio in Hillsboro, Virginia.

My education in horticultural and landscape design as well as residing in western Loudoun County for 23 years have greatly influenced the design elements in my work.  Whether the piece is functional or made for sheer delight, wheel-thrown or slab-built, each carries my non-traditional designs created with handmade stamps, carvings and forms.

I am a small batch potter focusing on one-of-a-kind pieces that may have relatives but never twins.  It is my intent that you are able to see/feel the hand of the maker in all of my pieces-the finger pull lines on wheel thrown pieces, carving lines on my sgraffito work, indentations from my hand-carved stamps, or the hand drawn lines of my mishima work.  My hope is that my stoneware pottery makes its way into homes where everyday use allows it to become part of traditions and memories for generations.
