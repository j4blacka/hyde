After enjoying career of over 30 years in senior staff positions and as an editorial and medical illustrator, I am now immersed in traditional oil painting as a portrait and figure painter. People fascinate me, which I feel contributes to my ability to capture their likeness. Through illustration, I'm drawn to the narrative in portrait and figure painting. I like to think that my paintings are more than just mirroring a person's features but capturing a moment of their essence that depicts who they are as a person. People are all about their relationships with each other, with their pets, and with the surrounding landscapes of their lives. Incorporating that landscape, that still life, their loves and sorrows fascinates me. I look to translate the "extraordinary ordinary" that I find so intriguing in my paintings.
