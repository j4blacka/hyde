Sedonaville Spirit Glass in Lovettsville features stained glass.

Called “the Kinkaid of Stained Glass,” Deb uses iridescents, dichroics, gemstones and crystals to infuse every piece with its own Inner Light.  Ever changing through the day depending on the direction of and type of light, moons shine, stars twinkle, eyes sparkle, building lights come alive, and skies brighten and darken between day and night.

From suncatchers and panels to birdbaths and garden ornaments, each piece is unique. Every piece is imbued with Spirit as it is created, and has a spiritual or mystical meaning and significance, so that it is not just a piece of art, it is Living Art.
