I am a landscape oil painter. I paint in my Loudoun County Artist home studio. I have shown with WLAST, the Leesburg Town Hall series twice, Friends of Franklin Park Art Gallery, AIM, and many more.

Many of my paintings feature our National Parks including Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Shenandoah Acadia and more.  My inspiration is drawn from the outdoors, friends, family, and a strong emotional attachment to beauty around me.  Primarily I see the world in lights, darks and shades of vibrant colors.  I enjoy painting out of doors and with students.  Painting is my connection to the past, present and future!
