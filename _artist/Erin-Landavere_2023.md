I moved to Loudoun County, VA in the mid 1990s and fell in love with what was a very rural county at the time. I visited many local potters, adding their unique mugs to my growing collection. I took lessons from potters [Shawn Grove]({% link _artist/Shawn-Grove_2023.md %}), [Bryan Mattraw]({% link _artist/Bryan-Mattraw_2023.md %}), and [Kristen Swanson]({% link _artist/Kristen-Swanson_2023.md %}). My love of creating pottery was born.

I find inspiration from the environment where I am – at the beach, in the mountains, or from memories. I created beach mugs from my visits to Hatteras Island, the New Jersey shore, Southern California beaches, and Puerto Rico.  We have collected shells from these beaches that go on top of our ocean candles. The first place I lived in Loudoun County was Downtown Leesburg, which was the inspiration for my “Downtown Leesburg” mugs, ornaments, and wall hangings. I also love rural Loudoun County, and I was inspired to create the “Loudoun County” mugs from caring for chickens and other farm animals.
