I am mostly a metal sculptor, using welded steel as my main medium.

I also am an experimental printmaker using the steel that I work with to create rust patterns on archival paper. These are sometimes made into assemblages and coated with encaustic wax.

I also do traditional printmaking, linocuts, engravings and silkscreen prints.
