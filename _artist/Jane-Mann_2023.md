As a fine art photographer, digital and intaglio printmaker, I look for the beauty, the unusual, or the irony in the details of a scene.

I particularly like to zoom in for a close look at a subject which might be ordinary if seen in normal perspective.  I also use atmosphere, composition, and light to dramatically enhance a subject and to impart a sense of place to landscapes or cityscapes.  Reflection, color, texture and contrast are also dimensions I explore and adjust to make an image more memorable.  My work with digital photographic equipment and programs has allowed me to create images and photomontages with which I hope to provoke thought and in which I encourage the viewer to participate.

Some photographs beg to be altered or to join others to make a statement or express an emotion.

Intaglio printmaking allows me to reduce an image to its essentials – light, shadow and line – with the added dimension of texture.
