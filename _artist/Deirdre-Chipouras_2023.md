My fiber art pieces are colorful and full of texture.

Pieces are made by hooking wool strips or punching yarn through a linen backing to make beautiful rug hooked pillows, mats, & wall art.  The mats are meant to be displayed on a surface, used as hot pad on a table, or as a layer on an ottoman or chair.

I also love refinishing a stool, ottoman, or chair and giving it new life by integrating my fiber art pieces as the seat or back.
