My work combines precious metals, precious metal clay (PMC), polymer clay, stones, plastics, glass, or whatever objects catch my eye. My designs are contemporary, combining both organic and geometric forms. I consider each one of my pieces a little piece of fine art. I like making pieces that are different and unique but still very wearable. The majority of my work includes pendants, necklaces, and earrings, though I do make other functional and nonfunctional items.

I started creating jewelry in college, at The Maryland Institute College of Art, where I majored in crafts, jewelry/metal being my main focus.  My jewelry designs won scholarships and awards throughout my college years. My work has also won numerous prestigious awards including 1st place in NICHE Awards, being a NICHE finalist 2 other times, and being a top 5 finalist 3 times in the International Saul Bell Jewelry Design competition.  I also have had my work published in numerous books and magazines.

I use many different techniques/methods to create my work including fabricating metals, Precious Metal ClayÂ®, which is comprised of either pure silver (fine silver), sterling silver, or 22K gold, Polymer Clay, and various beads, stones, and paints. I love making faux components too, such as boulder opals and wood. I strive always to improve my designs and skills and to make jewelry that is creative, unusual, elegant, and fun to wear.
