I seek to create beautiful, artistic jewelry that inspires and brings joy.

For some, jewelry is a decorative extension and expression of oneâ€™s personality.  For others, it embodies a wish, a memory or even a sacred object.  These are opportunities for my designs to speak to and enrich your story.

All my pieces are handmade with care using traditional silversmithing techniques.
<!-- , sourcing primarily US-mined turquoise. -->

I fused my nearly three decades of art expertise in painting, drawing, printmaking, photography and ceramics with the use of the metal clay to create Zia Design in 2009.  I currently use traditional silversmithing techniques and U.S. mined turquoise in my work.
