My works are mostly wheel thrown vessels. Occasionally, hand built clay embellishments accompany my pieces.

I have worked with electric, reduction, and soda kilns to fire my vessels. Along with these modern methods, I have been firing with primitive techniques: Raku, pit, naked Raku, and combination Raku and sagar. I sometimes fire twice in a quick succession to achieve the look I want. I put several coats of terra sigillata on the pot to encourage a certain base color. I experiment with different forms of pits or kilns, chemicals, and organic materials from my surroundings to enhance the color of my pieces, but in the end, the dancing flames decorate my pots.

My primitive fired vessels are for display only.  They have no glazes on them and will not hold water. Exposure to direct sun light for long periods is not recommended.

All my functional pieces have glazes on them to make them water tight.  They are dishwasher safe and microwave safe.
