I remember the first time a painting made me cry.  I have been moved by poetry and music to tears, but I had no idea that a piece of visual art could do that.  Since that time I have strived to create work that evokes a mood…specifically the awe, beauty, amusement, or mystery I feel when experiencing nature.

I paint from photographs as well as life, and I enjoy painting en plein air.  I work in several mediums, but soft pastel is my favorite.  I’m very active in the local art community as a member of the Loudoun Sketch Club, and an art instructor at the Great Falls School of Art and the Greenhouse at the Oatlands.  My work lives in collections around the world and I’ve received many awards over the last few years.
