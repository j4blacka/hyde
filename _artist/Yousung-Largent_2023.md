Yousung Choi Largent was born in South Korea, and earned her Bachelor’s Degree in Fine Arts: Pottery from Daegu Catholic University in the city of Daegu. Having lived in Round Hill, Virginia since 2014, she runs her own home ceramics and pottery studio, Yousung Choi Fine Art Pottery where she continues to pursue and share her passion for functional fine art. Much of Yousung’s work is wheel thrown stoneware, with some hand building and armature work. She takes much of her inspiration from nature, which stimulates a feeling in her that she wishes to emulate in others through her creations in clay. Her beautifully painted motifs are meticulously brushed by hand after the bisque firing, using vibrant and carefully selected tones of under-glaze.  All pieces are of heirloom quality, designed for functionality and are food, microwave, and dishwasher safe.
