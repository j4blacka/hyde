A family of artisans!

Spouses Edwin and Claire Cutshall, and their son, Logan Cutshall, work together to create heirloom fine jewelry pieces in 18K gold and platinum, with custom cut colored gemstones and diamonds.

Ed and Logan hand carve waxes for the lost wax casting process; they refine their metals, cast, set, and finish each piece.  Claire is our lapidary artist; she cuts gemstones for performance, not weight, resulting in stunning patterns and shapes.  Together, the family works to create pieces that will capture memories, and serve as touchstones for important life events for generations.
