Amy Berringer is a professional artist and art educator, who works in a variety of mediums.

In 2022, she challenged herself to discover the magic of working with soft pastels.

She was drawn to pastels for their saturated pigments, and the ability to work in a medium without dry time.  Her work echoes her appreciation of nature, travel and love for bold color. Raised in Jackson Hole Wyoming, Amy gained a love for art and the outdoors from a young age. She is particularly drawn to beautiful landscapes, flora and fauna.
