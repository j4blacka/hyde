I am a contemporary realist painter who enjoys still life and portrait painting.

I have been creating art for many years but more recently have been able forgo my former professions as designer and then teacher, to pursue fine art as a career.  My fondness for portraiture and figurative work extended to still life when I found that I could greatly increase my skill level through small exercises in still life painting. Moreover, all principles of design-- texture, color, emphasis, unity, harmony and repetition can be explored conveniently through the arrangement of objects, flowers and fruit at my table. The symbolic nature of a particular object when placed strategically provides a subtle narrative. Emphasis is a tool I often utilize as I am intuitively drawn to depict simple compositions. Accentuating the subject through glowing light or careful arrangement is vital. The painting methods employed are a combination of wet on wet and a more traditional method of layered glazing.
