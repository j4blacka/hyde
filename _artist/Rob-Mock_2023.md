In 1997 I decided to make my wife a wooden bookmark for a Christmas gift.

From those meager beginnings, my love of wood and woodworking has grown over the past 25 years.

Having created hundreds of one-of-a-kind sculptures, musical instruments, and gift items, my passion for woodworking continues to grow.
