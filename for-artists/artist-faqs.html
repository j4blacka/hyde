	<dt><h3>Eligibility</h3>Who is eligible to apply?</dt>
		<dd>Professional and emerging visual artists whose studios in Western Loudoun County meet specified criteria may apply as Studio Artists. Loudoun artists who do not have a Western Loudoun studio suitable for visitors may apply as Guest Artists.</dd>
	<dt>What qualifies as a studio?</dt>
		<dd>A studio is a place artwork is created on a regular basis. The studio must be established prior to the tour application deadline. The studio must be located in western Loudoun County.</dd>
	<dt>My studio is in a space shared with others. What should I do?</dt>
		<dd>If you have a multi-artist studio, all artists must be accepted by the jury in order to participate in the tour. We ask that if an artist is not accepted by the jury that they do not actively promote or sell their work the weekend of the tour in order to ensure a fair and successful tour for the juried artists. The only exception to the rule that each artist must apply individually is when two or more artists collaborate intimately to produce all the work they will offer on the tour (such a two jewelers who share the work of creating each piece). Two artists who produce their work independently, even if married or sharing a studio, must apply individually.</dd>
	<dt>What about galleries and shops?</dt>
		<dd>The tour is about working artists and studios. All artists must be juried and able to demonstrate their process. A retail establishment that is not a working studio does not qualify as a studio. </dd>
	<dt>What about Franklin Park Arts Center and the Round Hill Arts Center?</dt>
		<dd>Franklin Park Arts Center, the Friends of Franklin Park Arts Center and the Round Hill Arts Center are the founders of the tour and with the Town of Purcellville over the years have provided enormous financial and logistical support for WLAST. Because of these longstanding relationships, both Arts Centers and the Historic Train Station are eligible to host guest artists who might otherwise not be accepted on the tour due to space constraints. The planning committee strives to balance the number of artists at these locations with those at participating studios, in order to encourage visitors to explore the tour broadly.</dd>

<!-- Guest or Studio -->
	<dt><h3>Hosting or Being a Guest</h3>Should I host a guest artist?</dt>
		<dd>Yes, if you have space. We have noticed over the years that studios with multiple artists are popular tour locations.</dd>
	<dt>Do I need insurance for my studio?</dt>
		<dd>Yes, insurance is required for all studios on the tour.</dd>
	<dt>Can I have non-juried artists at my studio demonstrating and exhibiting? </dt>
		<dd>No.</dd>
	<dt>Can I sell others' work in my studio the weekend of the tour? </dt>
		<dd>No.<!-- This is a violation of the rules.  --></dd>
	<dt>What should I do if my studio is off the beaten track and hard to get to?  </dt>
		<dd>First, consider being a guest with another artist &mdash; studios with multiple artists are popular tour locations. Second, market, market, market yourself and your stop &mdash; it really helps with traffic.</dd>
	<dt>How do I get placed as a guest artist? </dt>
		<dd>The WLAST planning committee assigns guest artists with host artists who have room, based on medium, size and space requirements, precedent, and variety at each stop. We try very hard to place all guest artists in locations that work best for the tour and the artists. When the planning committee feels that a particular studio is too remote to receive sufficient traffic, we may suggest that the artist consider being a guest at another location instead.</dd>

<!-- Media to choose and photos to submit -->
	<dt><h3>Completing the Application</h3>What photos should I use in my application? </dt>
		<dd>This is a juried show with professional jurors. Submit your best quality high-resolution photos (well-lit, in focus, cropped to exclude distractions). Select images that represent your body of work in the medium or media you wish to show and demonstrate during the tour. <b><em>Your photos are the most important element used to jury your application</em></b> and will also be used to promote you and your work if you are accepted on the tour. You must submit at least ten but no more than fifteen images of your work (and two images depicting your studio if it is new to the tour, unless you are applying as a guest).</dd>
	<dt>I work in multiple mediums. What should I apply for? </dt>
		<dd>You may list multiple mediums on your application, but no more than the first three may be listed in the tour's printed material. When you apply, you must supply photos of work in each medium you will present on the tour. If you apply in multiple mediums, please submit at least three photos for each medium. During the weekend of the tour, you may not show or demonstrate work in a medium that was not juried and accepted for the tour. (Yes, you may be accepted in one medium but not in another one.)</dd>
	<dt>When will I be notified? </dt>
		<dd>Applicants will be notified of their jurying status by mid-February, 2023.</dd>
	<dt>What is the application fee?</dt>
		<dd>The application fee is $250 for artists applying as a guest and $200 for all others. Artists not selected will be refunded all but $50 of their fee. With the exception of VSA's Da Vinci Art Studio hosted by Franklin Park Arts Center, groups and guilds are no longer accepted on the tour, though individual members are certainly encouraged to apply and to mention their affiliations if they are interested in being placed together on the tour.</dd>
	<dt>Are there more conditions for participation?</dt>
		<dd>Yes. There are different terms for guest artists and studio artists, and general terms for all artists. All application terms are shown below.</dd>
