		<h2>2019 Western Loudoun Artists Studio Tour</h2>

<p>
Visual artists can apply online now for the 14th annual Western Loudoun Artists Studio Tour, to be held June 1 &amp; 2, 2019.
</p>

<p>
Loudoun artists working in all visual media may apply to this juried event. Those selected will open their studios to the public for two full days, exposing their work to visitors from the metropolitan region. Last year’s tour brought several thousand visitors into more than 30 studios and arts centers, allowing artists to connect with a targeted audience, increasing their visibility and providing an opportunity to promote and share their work.
</p>
<p><img width="100%" alt="" src="/images/thumbnails_1000.jpg"></p>
<p>
Professional and emerging visual artists whose studios in Western Loudoun County meet specified criteria may apply as Studio Artists. Loudoun artists who do not have a Western Loudoun studio suitable for visitors may apply as Guest Artists. Two- and three-dimensional work will be considered, including but not limited to painting, drawing, fiber art, wood, ceramics, photography, sculpture, and jewelry.
</p>

<p>
The deadline for submission is <b>Friday, February 1, 2019,</b> with no exceptions. Applicants currently impacted by the partial Federal government shutdown must still apply by the deadline, but may request a temporary deferment of the application fee in the Comments field of the application. Artists with deferred payments due who are accepted by the jury will be asked to complete their payments prior to final acceptance on the tour and prior to the production of our printed materials, with a deadline likely sometime in mid-March.
</p>

<p>
